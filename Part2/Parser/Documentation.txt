Part 2 of C- Compiler, Parser
Due 10/19/17 Submitted 10/19/17

Part of of the Compiler is the Parser. This program works by having the
lexical Analyzer in Project one out to a file called Tokens.txt. After that,
the Parser will read in the file and being parsing. The parsing is done by 
recursive descent, and a table was created to help guide the parser. At any 
time, if there is an error, the program will call the "Reject()" function
and proceed to display "REJECT" and end the session. However, if the parser
is able to navigate through all the way and there are no issues, then the
program will display "ACCEPT" and will then end the program.
