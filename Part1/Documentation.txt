Part 1 of C- Compiler, Lexical Analyzer
Due 2/2/17 Submitted 2/2/17



Program is designed to take in a file and look through
the file and tokenize what it is available as well as 
reporting any errors while tokenizing. The program will
take in the file, and break the file down line by line
and further break down each line into individual characters.
The characters are then analyzed into a character sequence
that will then compare to either delimeters, keywords, or 
numbers and then determine if it is a valid input or return
what kind of input it is.  The comment count is started at 0 
and will increment everytime there is a "/*" and decrement 
when there is a "*/" to allow for nested comments. An error is
reported from when the error first occurs until the next
delimeter or space.
